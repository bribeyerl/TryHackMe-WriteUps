## Passive Reconnaissance Overview

In passive reconnaissance, **you do not engage with the target directly**. You rely solely on publicly available knowledge.

**Examples of passive reconnaissance include:**
- Looking up DNS records from a public DNS server
- Checking job ads related to the target website
- Reading news articles about the target company

**Examples of active reconnaissance include:**
- Connecting to a target company's server (HTTP, FTP, SMTP)
- Calling the company in an attempt to obtain information (social engineering)
- Entering the company premises pretending to be a repairman (social engineering)
