# Basic XSS Testing Using BurpSuite

## Prerequisites

- Install [**FoxyProxy**](https://getfoxyproxy.org/) extension for Firefox.
- Have **BurpSuite** installed and running.

---

## Step 1: Configure FoxyProxy

1. Open **FoxyProxy** settings in Firefox.
2. Add a new proxy with the following configuration:
    - **Proxy Type:** HTTP
    - **IP Address:** `127.0.0.1`
    - **Port:** `8080`
    - (Adjust if your BurpSuite settings differ.)

> **Tip:**  
> Label this proxy clearly (e.g., "BurpSuite Proxy") so you can easily toggle it on/off.

---

## Step 2: Prepare BurpSuite

- Launch **BurpSuite**.
- Navigate to the **Proxy** tab.
- Confirm that **Intercept** is set to **ON**.

## Step 3: Locate and Test the Form

1. In Firefox, navigate to the **target URL** where the form is located.
2. Observe that **client-side filtering** is active on the form fields.

> **Important:**  
> Forms with client-side validation often still process dangerous input at the server level if bypassed manually.

3. Fill out the form using input that **complies** with the field restrictions.
4. Click **Submit Query!**.

---

## Step 4: Modify the Request in BurpSuite

1. In **BurpSuite**, locate the HTTP request triggered by the form submission.
2. Find the field you wish to target (e.g., `email`).
3. Replace its value with your XSS payload.

Example:

```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
